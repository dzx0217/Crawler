Cerebral organoids grown from human embryonic stem cells or human induced pluripotent stems cells closely mimic the human brain and serve as models for defining virus tropisms (which cells are infected) and subsequent effects on cell growth or cell death.  Collaborative work with other IMES faculty permits three-dimensional imaging of virus infections, and single cell sequence analysis distinguishes transcriptional profiles in infected and uninfected cells.', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)', '医学工程与科学学院', 'US');

In parallel to his PhD, as an independent side project, he co-invented optogenetic control of neurons, which is now used throughout neuroscience. Previously, he studied chemistry at the Texas Academy of Math and Science at the University of North Texas, starting college at age 14, where he worked in Paul Braterman\'s group on origins of life chemistry. He went on to earn three degrees in electrical engineering and computer science, and physics, from MIT, graduating at age 19, while working on quantum computing in Neil Gershenfeld\'s group.

These semi-automatic routines free us to think and attend to the world. But the habit system can also be hijacked by disease and drug exposure. The Graybiel Laboratory focuses on the habit system of the brain and our remarkable ability to switch from conscious activity to nearly non-conscious behavior. The goal of this research is to understand how we make and break habits and how the neurobiology of the habit system is helping to advance understanding of human problems ranging from Parkinson’s disease to obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders and addiction. Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that our ability to acquire habits depends on the basal ganglia, deep forebrain structures that are interconnected with the frontal cortex in a series of loop circuits. The development of recording techniques for monitoring neural activity in awake, behaving animals now makes it feasible to investigate what forms of neuronal representation are built up in the basal ganglia and cortico-basal ganglia loops as habits are acquired. The lab’s recordings from the striatum, the largest input side of the basal ganglia, suggest remarkable plasticity in the response properties of striatal neurons as animals learn sequential procedures and also as they undergo bouts of learning, extinction and reacquisition training. Single unit activity changes systematically through these bouts and so does ensemble activity. These results suggest that there is a form of ‘neural exploration’ followed by ‘neural exploitation’ in the basal ganglia as procedures are learned. After learning, the ensemble activity tends to emphasize the beginning and end of such procedures, as though setting up boundary states in higher-order representations. Such action-boundary representations can be found also in multi-electrode chronic recordings from the prefrontal cortex and striatum of primates. These and other findings support the view that basal ganglia-based circuits can build representations of sequential actions that facilitate their release or inhibition. Emotion is an important guide to these behaviors, and the lab studies how the emotional and motor systems of the brain interact. The lab has developed the view that the basal ganglia can influence not only motor pattern generators, but also cognitive pattern generators. Evidence suggests that the laying down of such representations involves genes expressed in basal ganglia-related networks, and the lab is also pursuing promising molecular approaches to understanding learning mechanisms of the basal ganglia. The lab is actively working on genes that were cloned by the lab and that appear to be important for controlling behavioral exploration and repetitive behaviors. These findings are proving to have direct relevance to clinical disorders involving the basal ganglia. Disorders of such basal ganglia plasticity could contribute to behavioral fixity and difficulty of initiation of behavior, as in Parkinson’s disease, or to the excessive release of behaviors, as in Huntington’s disease, or to the repetitive behaviors and thoughts characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders.', 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)', '脑与认知科学学院', 'US');

Mutant radish flies flunk one long-term memory test established by vertebrate researchers, but they pass the second like normal flies. Thus studies with radish indicate that there are at least two separate types of long-term memory.

Once we understand how these proteins bind to each other, we have the necessary tools to design molecules that inhibit or augment such interactions and we have used stapled peptides to this effect. We are also interested in understanding the dynamics of small G proteins, which can be studied in molecular detail by NMR, and how these are affected by binding to membranes and to other proteins.

Editing may be very selective, sometimes resulting in a single amino acid change in the encoded protein, but it may alternatively be widespread. In this case, \'hyper-editing\' of dsRNA can result in up to 50% of A residues being converted to I, which has a significant impact on both the sequence and structure of the dsRNA. Wholesale editing thus gives rise to distinct molecules that are readily recognizable in mammalian cells. The role(s) of these hyper-edited dsRNAs in cells are poorly understood. However, deletion of ADAR1, which is likely to play a substantial role in hyper-editing of long dsRNAs, results in embryonic lethality in mice – thereby demonstrating the importance of hyper-edited dsRNA.

Dr. Zatulovskiy demonstrated that cell growth dilutes the key cell cycle inhibitor RB (retinoblastoma protein) to trigger cell division. That smaller cells are born with higher concentrations of RB ensures that they have more time to grow and reach the target size before sufficiently diluting RB and progressing through the cell division cycle. This finding not only provides a long-sought molecular mechanism for cell size homeostasis, but it also has an important conceptual implication – namely, any process in the cell can be modulated by cell size as long as its positive and negative regulators differentially scale with cell size. In a follow-up study, Dr. Zatulovskiy with colleagues identified dozens of other proteins whose concentrations change with cell size (Lanz* and Zatulovskiy* et al., Mol Cell 2022; Zatulovskiy* and Lanz* et al., Front Cell Dev Biol 2022).

Iridescence is an optical trick generated by the interaction of light with minute structures organized on or just below the surface of plants and animals, thus creating visible colours that are independent of chemical pigments. In flowers, the iridescent effect is due to ordered striations (like those on a CD) of the cuticle on the petal epidermis and pollinators can use this iridescence as a cue to detect flowers. I developed Venice mallow (Hibiscus trionum) as a model species and combined biomechanical modelling and optics with modern genetic analysis, live-tissue imaging and behavioural ecology to understand how and when these nanostructures develop.

His lab is interested in how such fundamental differences in embryo size, cell number and energy supply have influenced the interpretation of conserved regulatory networks and patterning mechanisms by individual cells. The central aim of his research is to uncover the mechanisms that confer information across biological scales. This might be through the generation of emergent properties such as pattern formation and morphogenesis.

Most of my publications concern protein synthesis, especially the phenomenon of ribosomal frameshifting, a translational regulatory event employed by numerous viral and some cellular genes. The work includes the first demonstration of a role for RNA pseudoknots in the regulation of translational elongation, the development of an exogenous tRNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, the description of novel translational recoding events in cellular genes, the first visualisation of mammalian ribosomes stalled during translocation and the first demonstration of -2 frameshifting at a viral frameshifting signal.  More recently, we have started investigation of the protein-dependent frameshifting signals of cardioviruses and arteriviruses, and have exploited ribosome profiling to examine these regulatory signals within the context of infected cells.

Most of my publications concern protein synthesis, especially the phenomenon of ribosomal frameshifting, a translational regulatory event employed by numerous viral and some cellular genes. The work includes the first demonstration of a role for RNA pseudoknots in the regulation of translational elongation, the development of an exogenous tRNA-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, the description of novel translational recoding events in cellular genes, the first visualisation of mammalian ribosomes stalled during translocation and the first demonstration of -2 frameshifting at a viral frameshifting signal.  More recently, we have started investigation of the protein-dependent frameshifting signals of cardioviruses and arteriviruses, and have exploited ribosome profiling to examine these regulatory signals within the context of infected cells.

It is now unquestionable that transmission of Plasmodium to the mosquito can be reduced by transmission-blocking drugs (e.g. mefloquine, primaquine, ACTs and atovaquone); and by transmission-blocking vaccines and antibodies, targeting parasite stages that establish infection within the mosquito (e.g. gametocytes, gametes, zygotes and ookinetes).

We demonstrated for the first time that the miR-371~373 and miR-302/367 clusters are highly over-expressed in all malignant GCTs, regardless of patient age, histological subtype or anatomical site (published in Cancer Research in 2010). This is a specific change, as these microRNAs are not co-ordinately dysregulated in any other malignancy or disease state. We subsequently were the first to demonstrate the potential utility of specific circulating microRNAs for diagnosis, disease-monitoring and detection of relapse in GCTs as well as other childhood tumours.', 'University of Cambridge', '病理学学院', 'UK');

Selectivity between channel types, especially subtypes with high sequence identity in a druggable pocket, presents a key limitation. In contrast, immunological agents can exhibit supreme specificity and therefore selectivity for a single ion channel subtype. Traditionally however, immunological agents have been utilized in passive binding roles to “label” ion channels, rather than as pharmacological tools, i.e. as agonists, modulators and inhibitors. This is a huge missed opportunity for the field of neuropharmacology. The development of such antibodies will reveal fundamental insights into the molecular underpinnings of neurological function and propel the advancement of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Necessary for this are improvements in CNS antibody delivery.

These hairs are always oriented in a particular direction; in the wing all the hairs are pointing distally, an example of what is known as planar polarity. How is this orientation achieved? One possibility is that each cell respondes to a global polarity signal as do Dictyostelium amoeba that are polarised and attracted by a source of cAMP. There is, however, evidence that a global polarity signal cannot be the only cause of polarisation: There are a number of fly genes that when mutated produce an abnormal, disturbed polarity. When a group of cells mutant for one of these genes is made in a otherwise normal fly, wild type cells adjacent to the mutant ones also show a disturbed polarity, even pointing their hairs in the direction opposite to normal. Thus, cells not only may respond to a global polarity system but they are also able to coordinate their polarity with with that of their neighbours. We are trying to understand how this global signalling and the local coordination occur, with the aim of understanding the logical relationship between the different components of planar polarity.', 'University of Cambridge', '动物学学院', 'UK');

More recently, I have realised that it might also be important to produce the food and the other agricultural products that people require on as little land as possible, and to use as much of the spared land as possible for large blocks of the natural habitats that many wild species need. This conflict, between modifying farming methods so as to share farmland with wild species, but by doing so potentially placing species that need large tracts of natural habitats at greater risk, is a real personal dilemma for me.  With Andrew Balmford and Ben Phalan, I have set up a research programme to collect hard evidence about whether the dilemma really exists and, if it does, how it can be resolved.', 'University of Cambridge', '动物学学院', 'UK');

A strong current interest is in the genetics of carotenoid coloration which up to now has been severely neglected. We recently made the exciting discovery of a locus involved in converting dietary yellow carotenoids to bright red carotenoids for colour displays in birds, that is opening up many novel avenues of research. We also have a longstanding interest in the genetics of melanin-based coloration in birds, and are extending early studies on single locus polymorphisms underlying melanism to the evolution and molecular basis of plumage patterning, and the population genetics of melanism.
